# Open Pit Detection

A computer vision pipeline for detecting open pits or hazardous ground openings in industrial and construction sites, aimed at preventing accidents through automated visual monitoring.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project uses **YOLOv8** for object detection to identify open pits in images and videos.  
It is trained on a **custom YOLO-format dataset** with bounding box annotations for open pits under various lighting and environmental conditions.

The system is designed to work in **real-time** for surveillance cameras, alerting operators when a pit is detected.

## âœ¨ Features
- Real-time open pit detection in images/videos.
- Robust performance in varied lighting and weather conditions.
- Easy-to-train on new datasets for different environments.
- Outputs bounding boxes with confidence scores.
- Supports both **offline image analysis** and **live RTSP stream processing**.
